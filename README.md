# Graph Homomorphism Convolution
Proof of concept for Graph Homomorphism Convolution.
http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01214 (ICML'20)

Note: Code for left homomorphism is for our ICML'20 paper.
Code for right homomorphism is our continued work.

## Setup
To obtain required packages and install our modules, run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This script installs `homlib` and `ghc`.

## Download and pack data
This package is not dependent on `torch-geometric` but we will use 
`torch-geometric` to load and pack data. Download `data.zip` from
```
https://drive.google.com/file/d/15w7UyqG_MjCqdRL2fA87m7-vanjddKNh/view?usp=sharing
```
and extract to `data/`. For example MUTAG dataset should have: `data/MUTAG.graph`
, `data/MUTAG.X`, `data/MUTAG.y`, and `data/MUTAG.folds`. 

## Quick run with ipython
```
from ghc.homomorphism import hom 
from ghc.utils.data import load_data
from ghc.utils.hom import tree_list

graphs, X, y = load_data("MUTAG", "./data")
trees = tree_list(4, num_loops=1)

# right hom
print(hom(graphs[0], trees[-1]))
```

## Run experiments
Experiment scripts are placed in the top level of this repository and named 
by the machine learning model. In general, a 10-fold CV score is reported.
For example,
```
python models/mlp.py --data mutag --hom_type tree --hom_size 6 
python models/mlp.py --data mutag --hom_type labeled_tree --hom_size 6
```
The 10-fold splits for MUTAG, COLLAB, IMDBBINARY, IMDBMULTI, NCI1, PROTEINS, and
PTC are taken from `weihua916/powerful-gnns`. The others are generated with 
`sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold` at random seed 0.

Note: CPU run will cause some segmentation fault upon script exit.

Note: There is a bug in homlib for `atlas[100:]`.
